# Haywire

This is our group project for Introduction to Game Development Tools at University of Turku, Autumn 2019. 
The game is a 2D interactive storytelling game inspired by Stanley Parable. 

You can play this game by downloading the Build folder and running the `exe` file. This game is playable only on Windows.

## Story Summary

You are a new programmer sent in by a military general to shut down a rogue AI. 
Obviously, the AI is not very friendly to an uninvited guest and it will do everything to get you out of its home.
